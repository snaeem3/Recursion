# Recursion

This repository contains the solutions to the [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-recursion#project-merge-sort) Recursion exercises.

The first problem demonstrates the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) using 2 different techniques.

- The first technique uses a for-loop. This can be shown by running `node 1-Fibonacci/fibs.js` in the terminal
- The second technique uses recursion. This can be shown by running `node 1-Fibonacci/fibsRec.js` in the terminal

The second problem demonstrates the [Merge Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) algorithm. This can be shown by running `node 2-Merge/mergeSort.js` in the terminal
